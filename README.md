## Overview

Shadw UI streamlines UI development by providing:

- Consistent styling
- Hundreds of customizable components
- Regular updates and new component additions
- All components support light and dark mode out of the box

## Getting Started

Shadw UI is designed to integrate seamlessly with Next.js projects, but the components are also compatible with any React-based project. The components follow shadcn conventions, so they’ll feel familiar to anyone who has used shadcn before.

**1. Set up the required files:**

- Install `shadcn ui` in your project.

Note: If you're not using shadcn.

**2. Copy and paste the components you need into your project.**
 
Note: Browse the Shadw UI library and copy the components you need into your project.

## Terms of Use
